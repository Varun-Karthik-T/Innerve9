# Contracker

**Eliminating Corruption with Every Block**

## Introduction

In India, the public tender and contract system faces challenges related to transparency and accountability, often leading to corruption and inefficiencies. Contracker is a blockchain-based solution designed to eliminate corruption in government tender processes, ensuring efficient and transparent public project management.

## Problem Statement

Corruption and inefficiencies in public works projects lead to:

- Manipulation of bids and unfair contract allocations.
- Misuse of allocated funds during project execution.
- Opaque verification processes for contractor spending and project completion.
- Limited public participation in validating project outcomes.

## Solution

Contracker leverages blockchain technology to:

1. **Report Issues:** Citizens report public issues (e.g., road damage, water logging) with geolocation data.
2. **Transparent Tender Allocation:** Governments respond with solutions and release tenders transparently on the blockchain.
3. **Spending Logs:** Contractors log expenditures, creating tamper-proof records on the blockchain.
4. **Voting Mechanism:** An automated voting system with government panels validates contractor spending with a majority rule.
5. **Public Validation:** Citizens participate in voting to validate project completion and quality.
6. **Immutable Records:** All activities are logged in a secure, transparent ledger.

## Flowchart

1. Citizens report issues.
2. Government evaluates and releases a tender.
3. Contractors submit bids and log expenditures.
4. Voting by government panels and the public on completion quality.
5. Final validation recorded on the blockchain.
